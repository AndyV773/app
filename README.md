# Black Adder

[Black Adder App](https://andyv773.github.io/app/)

Black Adder is a project I created as an idea for a blockchain platform that ultimately did not take off.  
The concept was to give users an all-in-one place to keep up to date with their cryptocurrency daily prices and portfolio.

Users would check in each day to collect apples, which could then be used to spin a wheel to win prizes - for example, blockchain tokens or a free NFT. From the rewards section, users could send prizes to their wallet by entering their wallet address.

The project was built entirely with front-end technologies before I started learning back-end development, so it uses browser local storage to save user state.
